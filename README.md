Trading Algos 

NOTES
- on 27-6-24 a logn positon was entered (price on BB did not cross, but this data is from EOD, so it condisdered fine.) Why the MACD was not in alignment this day and the enxt day the trade was closed whereas it was a massive bull run trade. Investigate how can the MACD Effect us this way ? Do we need to change the logic ?
